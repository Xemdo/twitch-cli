- `ref` is used for indicating that the value of something can be overriden by the CLI's execution. It's basically a key representing that.

- Files in `_ref` dir will only ever represent a singular reference, and thus should only have a single item (aligned with MockAbstractData's format) in their map

- Command-line flags should only exist for `subscription` fields, not `event` fields
